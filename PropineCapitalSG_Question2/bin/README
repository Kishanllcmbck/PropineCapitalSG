'main' package contains the index class file to run the program.

you have two options to run the program.
you may either run the program by multithreading or without it.

ADVANTAGES BY RUNNING THE PROGRAM THROUGH MULTITHREADING
1. process time decrease by approximately 50% which would be more substantial in a server grade processor with multicores.
2. decrease in memory utilization.

if you chose to run the program by multithreading please note the below:-
kindly specify the int variable 'divideMultipleBasingOnCPUCores' between 10 to 100 for the program to run in threadsafe behaviour.
more the threads, more the overload on task scheduler for the threads.
